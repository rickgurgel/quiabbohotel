# Quiabbo Hotel

## Hotel Booking System

Quiabbo Hotel is one out of four projects that I'm developing as final work for (Thiago AndrÃ©)[https://github.com/thiagoandrecardoso/] POO class.

-> For this project, there were some requirements achieve:
* The System must add and remove rooms;
* Schedule reservations;
* List all reservations.

-> For evaluation, these were the rules:
* Single responsability principle;
* Polimorfism;
* Encapsulation;

## BONUS CHALLENGE:
* Implement a discount system for long staying reservations.
